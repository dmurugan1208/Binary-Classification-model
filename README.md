# Binary-Classification-model
Introduction: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the world. It 
accounts for 25% of all cancer cases and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. 
The key challenge against its detection is how to classify tumors into malignant 
(cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). In this project, you are required to complete the 
analysis of classifying these tumors using machine learning. I have implemented five binary classification models, including Logistic Regression, SVM,  Decision Tree, KNN, and Neural Network, train them on the given dataset “train.csv”, evaluate the trained models on “test.csv”, and analyze their performance. 

Dataset Description: There are 398 training samples and 167 testing samples, each 
with 30 features, 1 ID number, and 1 prediction class (value “M” is interpreted as “tested 
malignant for breast cancer” and “B” as "tested benign for breast cancer").

Steps done:
1.Data Pre-Processing
2.Data Visualization - conducted PCA on the dataset.
3. Machine Learning algorithms implementation- Logistic Regression with Regularizer, SVM, Neural Network, Decision tree, KNN.
