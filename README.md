# Binary-Classification-model
Introduction: Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer affecting women worldwide, accounting for 25% of all cancer cases. In 2015 alone, over 2.1 million people were impacted. A major challenge in its diagnosis is accurately classifying tumors as either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). This project focuses on analyzing and classifying tumors using machine learning. I have implemented five binary classification models—Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN, and Neural Network. These models were trained using the dataset “train.csv” and evaluated on “test.csv” to assess their performance.

Dataset Description: The dataset includes 398 training samples and 167 testing samples, each consisting of 30 features, 1 ID number, and 1 prediction class. The prediction class labels "M" represent malignant cases, while "B" represent benign cases.

Steps Completed:

Data Pre-Processing
Data Visualization - Performed PCA on the dataset.
Machine Learning Model Implementation - Applied Logistic Regression with Regularization, SVM, Neural Network, Decision Tree, and KNN algorithms.
